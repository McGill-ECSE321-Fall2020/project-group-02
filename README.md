# Online Art Gallery Application

The main scope of this application is to provide the local artists the possibility to sell their artworks on the online gallery's website. On the other end, the customer that is looking for an art piece on the online gallery's website is provided the ability to buy the artwork posted by one or many artists by going through an online payment process. The artwork(s) are then delivered either to his specified address (home delivery option) or to the local gallery's premises where the customer can directly pick-up the purchased art pieces. A percentage of total price of all artworks sold by the artists on the site are collected as commissions by the local gallery.
